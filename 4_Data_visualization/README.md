## by (Kitwana Shebabetsi Ezechiel)


## Dataset

My dataset was the information about bike-sharing system from San Francisco Bay area. It is only for the year 2017, month of Frebruary. After gathering the data, i processes with few assessment in order to understand better the data and get some issues from it. After assessing, i went through the cleaning because some of the values in the dataset were untidy. Example of untidy values i found: Missing values in some columns,  innapropriate datatypes found and Some no necessary columns.
I make sure to clean these above issues before going for exploration. 


## Summary of Findings

What i fount is that, many people from San Francisco prefer riding bike than expected. There are two types of users here, `Subscriber` and `Customer`, the Subscriber user type has the most rides but they are all short duration in weedays, this is because many `Subscribers` rent bikes for the purpose of riding to work and bringing it back from __(8 AM and 9 AM)__ to __(5 PM and 6 PM)__ respectively. The longest rides for both `Customers` and `Subscribers` take place in the weekends. This is absolutely acceptebe, because in the weekends people are used to rent bikes for personal enjoyment. Customers are usually tourrists and they are the ones that rent bike in the weekends the most.


## Key Insights for Presentation

- The relationships between the starting day, hour and different gendersa and user type
- What is in the ride duration compared to the type of user. 
- The ride duration based on the whole member characteristics.
