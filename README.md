# Data Analyst Projects
<hr>
Data analysis is a collection , transformation and organization of the data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions and drive informed decision-making.
Any data analysis project must stand on this definition.

This collection of projects here, are my own works that i completed through my learning journey to become a data analyst. As, I've just defined what a data analyst is, these projects too, meet the conditions of that definition but all of the projects are splitted apart for the purpose of the learning steps and each one of them is about one of the data analysis process or covers two processes. I am not going to talk much about the data analysis process here but i might say that i followed the principle of __Udacity__. Even though this repository is meant to be for just the projects i accomplished throught my learning journey at udacity, i decided to add more data analytics projects that i did for my personal experiences but they are all relatable to this scope.

There are vaious principles out there on data analysis process and they are all amost similar, but i decided to use the one of __Udacity__. It is as follow:
- Step 1: Ask questions
- Step 2: Wrangle data
- Step 3: Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Step 4: Draw conclusions (or even make predictions)
- Step 5: Communicate your results

So, the projects were designed according to the above steps and they are:
- 1_Exploratory_data_analysis_(EDA)
- 2_Analyse_ABtest_results
- 3_Data_wrangling
- 4_Data_visulization
