# Data Analyst Projects
<hr>
Data analysis is a collection , transformation and organization of the data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions and drive informed decision-making.
Any data analysis project must stand on this definition.

This collection of projects here, are my own works that i completed through my learning journey to become a data analyst. As, I've just define what a data analyst is, these projects too, meet the conditions of that definition but all of them are splitted apart for the purpose of the learning steps and each one of them is about one of the data analysis process or covers two processes at once. I am not going to talk much about the data analysis process here but i might say that i followed the principle of __Udacity__.

There are vaious principles out there on data analysis process and they are all amost similar, but i decided to use the one of __Udacity__. It is as follow:
- Step 1: Ask questions
- Step 2: Wrangle data
- Step 3: Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Step 4: Draw conclusions (or even make predictions)
- Step 5: Communicate your results

So, the projects were designed according to the above steps and they are:
- 1_Exploratory_data_analysis_(EDA)
- 2_Analyse_ABtest_results
- 3_Data_wrangling
- 4_Data_visulization
