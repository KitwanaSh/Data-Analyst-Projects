## Online Retail Store (Data Visualization project)
This is mainly  a data visualization project i took as a virtual intership at Tata Group from the forage.

With this project, i started by framing the business scenario which is about to draft questions that i think will be important and relevant to the CEO and CMO. This preparation would be my guide as i develop my presentation. These questions are both qualitative and quantitative.

After framing 8 questions (4 for the CEO and other 4 for the CMO), i compiled 4 visulizations in order to communicate the insights and analysis for the data. I used power Bi for the visualizations.

If you want to deeply read about this project i provided an article on medium about it. You can view it here.
