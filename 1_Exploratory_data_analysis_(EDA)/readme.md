## Investigate a dataset
<hr>
In this project, i investigate a dataset about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database from 1960 to 2015 and then i communicate my findings about it.<br>
I asked questions, gather the data, assess the data, do a little cleaning (eg. revove duplicates and some columns), do a deep exploratory data analysis of this datasets then comuncate my findings. This seems like doing the whole data analysis steps, i agree. The purpose of doing so, is to get the big picture of the data analysis. This is a kind of an introduction to data analysis but each step will be covered on its own project.

### Tools used
I use the python libraries such as, numpy, matplotlib and and pandas to make my analysis easier.
<br>I needed to install python with the above libraries.

### Why this project
In this project, i go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together because after completing this project, I:
- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Am comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
- Have experience communicating the results of your analysis
- Am able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
- Am familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
